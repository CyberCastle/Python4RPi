# Last version of Python for Raspberry Pi 4

This repository is configurated to compile and package (using CircleCI CI/CD) the latest stable version of Python for easy installation on Raspberry Pi 4. In theory it should work on any other ARM64v8 device running Debian or  derivatives.

## Installation

Download and run [*install-python.sh*](install-python.sh), with root privileges.

## Changelog

- 02-15-2022, Packaging Python 3.11.2
